2020 Level 1 Project for team SSP

You need to install flask - pycharm will do this for you. If you use conda, use 
```conda activate <envname>``` (replace envname and the <>'s with the conda envierment you want to run) followed by ```conda install flask```. 
Make sure that you are using this environment in pycham or visual code or it won't work, unless that env already has flask too. 


## Running the server 
Run server.py after installing flask. You should be able to access the server at the following 
URLs

* http://localhost:8181
